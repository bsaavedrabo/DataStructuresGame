# DataStructuresGame

This is a game intended to promote spaced-repetition revisions of the Data Structures class using C++. 

Solution Challenge submission, 2023 

### Problem Statement: 
CSC 236, Data Structures is known for being the hardest class in the Computer Science major at Berea College. There is a learning curve when transitioning from Python to a static language likeC++. Also, the amount of information that is shared during 236 makes it hard to consolidate information and achieve long-term retention of the material. 

### Motivation:
Data structures are ways to systematically organize and store data in programs and they have advantages and disadvantages. We can make relatable situations in the game that can help students review the contents by using spaced repetition. Games are a way to encourage failure in a low-stake environment so they gain awareness of their individualâ€™s weaknesses on the material.
