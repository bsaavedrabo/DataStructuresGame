# Object-Oriented Odyssey: A C++ Learning Adventure

This is a game intended to help students learn Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm using C++. 

Solution Challenge submission, Spring 2023 

## Problem Statement: 
CSC 236, Data Structures is known for being the hardest class in the Computer Science major at Berea College. There is a learning curve when transitioning from Python to a static language like C++. Data structures are ways to systematically organize and store data in programs and they have advantages and disadvantages. We can make relatable situations or stories that can help students learn OOP in C++ interactively.

## Features:

- *Interactive storytelling:* Create interactive stories that engage students in a narrative that incorporates the use of data structures. For example, a story about a character who needs to use a data structure to solve a problem or accomplish a task.

- *Spaced repetition algorithm:* Use a spaced repetition algorithm to ensure that students review concepts at the right intervals for long-term retention. This can be done by tracking student progress and adjusting the review schedule based on their performance.
- *Personalized learning*: customize learning experience based on individual needs and preferences.

- *Practice problems:* provide with practice problems with provide immediate feedback.

- *Progress tracking:* provide students with a dashboard that shows their progress, achievements, and areas for improvement, so they can monitor their own progress and stay motivated.
