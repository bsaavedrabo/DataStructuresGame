This is a game intended to promote spaced-repetition revisions of the Data Structures class using C++. 

Solution Challenge submission, 2023 

Problem Statement: 
CSC 236, Data Structures is known for being the hardest class in the Computer Science major at Berea College. There is a learning curve when transitioning from Python to a static language like C++. Data structures are ways to systematically organize and store data in programs and they have advantages and disadvantages. We can make relatable situations or stories that can help students in the transition of Python to C++. 


Our solution:
A web app with a series of projects that start like written stories. Through the projects they will learn how to properly use data structures as well as C++ syntax.
